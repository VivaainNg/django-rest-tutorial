## django-rest-tutorial

This repo is just for me to keep track/practice on Django along with DRF (djangorestframework).

### To-do lists:

* [X] Remove the current/existing setups for Windows.

* [X] Setup new venv for Django.

* [X] Create a requirements.txt to list out all the necessary Python modules.

* [ ] Added functions-based views vs class-based views in Django.


### Installing

A step by step guide on how to setup your local environment/setting.


1: Create a local venv(virtualenv)

```
$ python3 -m venv <envName>
```

2: Activate the venv

```
$ source <envName>/bin/activate
```

3: Install all the modules listed within requirements.txt

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4: To run the Django server at localhost:

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

4: To activate Django shell in IPython:

```
$ python manage.py shell -i ipython
```
